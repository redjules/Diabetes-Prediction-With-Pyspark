# Diabetes Prediction With Pyspark MLLIB

# Project Description

In this project, we will build a logistic regression model using Pyspark MLLIB to classify patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic. We will use the popular Pima Indian Diabetes data set. Our goal is to use a simple logistic regression classifier from the pyspark Machine learning library for diabetes classification. We will be carrying out the entire project on the Google Colab environment with the installation of Pyspark.
